"""
A simple library that implements a pingback client.  The library supports
version 1.0 of the pingback library, based upon the specification published
at http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback.

Implementing a pingback server is beyond the scope of this library simply
because of the very application-specific nature of a server.  However, it is
also trivially easy to create a pingback server by using Python's
SimpleXMLRPCServer module.  The following simple framework could be used
by a CGI script to implement a pingback server::

    def pingback(sourceURI, targetURI):
        '''Do something interesting!'''
        return "arbitrary string return value."

    import SimpleXMLRPCServer
    handler = SimpleXMLRPCServer.CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler()
    handler.register_function(pingback, "pingback.ping")
    handler.handle_request()

It would still be necessary to provide an X-Pingback HTTP header which pointed
at the given CGI script.
